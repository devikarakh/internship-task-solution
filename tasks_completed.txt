Task 1 — Fix Login Verification
I corrected the broken password verification logic. The project compared the hashed password directly with the plain password, which always failed. I replaced this with proper Argon2 verification using:
pwd_context.verify(password, user.hashed_password)
I also switched the hashing backend from bcrypt to Argon2 because bcrypt caused issues on Python 3.12.
Result:
Login now works correctly with valid credentials and fails for invalid ones.


Task 2 — Registration Hardening
I improved security and validation during user registration by adding:
Duplicate email detection
Strong password rules (minimum 8 characters, must include letters and numbers)
Argon2 hashing for safe password storage
Meaningful error responses

Result:
Registration now prevents weak passwords and duplicate accounts.


Task 3 — Implement /records/search Endpoint
I built an advanced search endpoint for filtering stored records.
It supports:
Category filter
Date range filter (start_date, end_date)
Multiple filters together

Result:
Users can now query records based on category and time period.


Task 4 — Implement /records/stats Endpoint
I created a record statistics endpoint that aggregates:
Total count of records per category
Most recent created_at timestamp for each category
This uses an efficient SQLAlchemy GROUP BY query.

Result:
The system now provides quick insights into stored data.


Task 5 — Bonus: Error Handling Improvements
I improved error handling across the project by adding:
Safe database session handling
Fallback responses for database failures
Try/except blocks in key CRUD operations


Result:
The backend now behaves more reliably and avoids silent crashes.
